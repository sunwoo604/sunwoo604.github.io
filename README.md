# Sunwoo's Portfolio
Hi! ðŸ‘‹  My name is Sunwoo Kim who is currently majoring in Data Science, minoring in Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego!
Here are some projects that I have done so far!
## [Shakespeare Sonnet Autogenerate NLP](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ShakespeareNLP)
### Character Level RNN
-  Divided every string into each character and assigned unique index to each unique character and converted each character into a numeric value.

### Word Level RNN
- Tokenized every string into every word(including punctuation) and assigned a unique index to each unique w,ord and converted each character into a numeric value
- Implemented both single and multilayer RNN

## [Read and Category Prediction](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ReadCategoryPrediction)
### Read Prediction
- Used Logistic regression to determine whether user had read or not
- Given input for the predction was user id and the book id

### Category Prediction
- Tried 2 different ways to predict(creating own featuer vectors and tfidf), and decided to use tfidf
- Convert each review_text to tfidf vector after removing stopword to prevent confusion

## [Court Decision Prediction](https://github.com/sunwoo604/CourtDecisionPrediction)
- Predict if the court favors the complaint or not
- Decision Tree Classifier was used

## [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ScratchDecisionTree)
- Conducted Decision Tree from scratch with different uncertainty measurement
- Trained with real life dataset

## [Web VR Environment with Flask Server](https://github.com/sunwoo604/Aframe-Flask_Development_Server)
- Web VR environmet using HTML/A-frame and javascript for the functionality
- Built development server using Flask
