# Data Science Portfolio
## [Project 1: Read and Category Prediction](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ReadCategoryPrediction)
### Read Prediction

- Given input for the predction was user id and the book id
### Category Prediction

- Convert each review_text to tfidf vector after removing stopword to prevent confusion
