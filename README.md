## [GWAS Database Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sunwoo.kim1101/viz/GWASDatabaseDashboardPublic/Overview)
### George Lab Database
George Lab's GWAS experiment is developed through the Azure data warehouse. After the automated data engineering process, the data is uploaded to the combined database
### Tableau Visualization
This visualization allows the researcher to access different values of dependent variables and the distribution of them per database, cohort, and sex. 
Different types of visualization can be accessed by clicking on different buttons on the navigator bar and each visualization allows to filter and investigate specific rats per types of interest and separated by different visual marks such as color and shapes. 
There is the internal version of visualization that is accessible by only permitted users and this visualization is directly connected to the Azure Database. For the researcher outside of the lab who is interested, the nonsynchronous public version is published through Tableau Public and the link is hyperlinked above.


## [Shakespeare Sonnet Autogenerate NLP](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ShakespeareNLP)
### Character Level RNN
-  Divided every string into each character and assigned unique index to each unique character and converted each character into a numeric value.

### Word Level RNN
- Tokenized every string into every word(including punctuation) and assigned a unique index to each unique w,ord and converted each character into a numeric value
- Implemented both single and multilayer RNN

## [UCL Liveboost Visualization for FC Online 4](https://github.com/sunwoo604/FCOnline4_UCL_Liveboost_VIz)
- Web scraped each player's live boost information
- Bracket formatted visualization to show the progress of each team in UCL tournament and each team's logo and game is clickable which allow user to view game results and player's stat
- Geospatial visualization to allow users to view each club's origin country.

## [Read and Category Prediction](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ReadCategoryPrediction)
### Read Prediction
- Used Logistic regression to determine whether user had read or not
- Given input for the predction was user id and the book id

### Category Prediction
- Tried 2 different ways to predict(creating own featuer vectors and tfidf), and decided to use tfidf
- Convert each review_text to tfidf vector after removing stopword to prevent confusion

## [Court Decision Prediction](https://github.com/sunwoo604/CourtDecisionPrediction)
- Predict if the court favors the complaint or not
- Decision Tree Classifier was used

## [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/sunwoo604/ScratchDecisionTree)
- Conducted Decision Tree from scratch with different uncertainty measurement
- Trained with real life dataset

## [Web VR Environment with Flask Server](https://github.com/sunwoo604/Aframe-Flask_Development_Server)
- Web VR environmet using HTML/A-frame and javascript for the functionality
- Built development server using Flask
